I kept going to pet it but would stay pretty far back from the gate and just barely touch it whereas everyone else was straight cuddling with the tiger. People were playing games with it and im pretty sure it could talk. You were hanging out with some of these kids and were having some long talks with this one girl who is from nakhraas and meanwhile I was doing other stuff. Eventually you were gonna leave to go skiing with your NUCR friends and only said bye to her and you guys had some private stuff you were talking about and then you straight up ignored me bc I had just popped in the convo and so I got mad jealous for some reason lol and then I was talking to that girl and this other dude and we went to the slopes cuz everyone was going and the general town itself was clearing out cuz it was a day to go to the slopes, except we didn’t go to ski. In fact, someone was wearing shorts! So we went up and climbed up this treehouse that everyone has to climb in order to get to the slope. But for people who don’t want to ski it’s just a fun thing to climb and there was one more thing we had to climb thru that was similar to a treehouse. I saw you walking on your skis uphill towards the first lift and you had your red winter coat on and a backpack and I was like what a noob why the heck does he have such a big backpack for skiing. Then I just chilled in the treehouse thing with that girl and we talked about some random things</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
