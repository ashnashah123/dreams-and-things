Somehow we ended up at our fam friends house who live in San Jose who I just visited and we were roaming around. Everyone was frustrated by the project so anger was generally just brewing. I think it then flashed to me in high school randomly and I was walking to my English class and we had a vocab test. I learned all the words that morning so I was pretty nervous cuz I never end up remembering enough. I was looking for my friend who I liked at one point but then hadn’t seen or talked to in 2 years and saw a tiny glimpse of him whip around the lockers. I think I then went into class and there wasn’t enough room to sit as my teacher was talking so I stood to the side w a few people. He handed out the tests and we all sat down and I sat on the floor. I was having such a tough time and someone I was sitting next to and I guess was friends with offered to help me cheat and just whisper the answers to me. I felt so uncomfy w this but I couldnt make much noise so I tried to tune him out? I think there was a prank being played w some of the kids who were sitting outside the room bc there rly wasn’t enough space and so I was paying so much attention to it and was kinda involved bc we were pranking my teacher that My progress in the test when everyone finished was simply answering the first question. I was embarrassed but had to tell my teacher i was still working and he gave me a sheet of labels that had all the words on them without the definition and it made it way easier since I had straight up forgotten the words themselves. After the test I met up w that friend who I hadn’t seen in 2 years and we discussed some academic challenges he was acing and I was like this is so boring why are we talking about this.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">I believe it then flashed back to the house in SJ. They had a really nice big house with lots of cool floors and it seemed as if I was navigating nyc when I was going around their house. I think we played hide and seek. At one point we were in a car and they (my teammates who I think were my brother and my cousin somehow) needed me to drop them off at a restaurant and I looked it up and it was all the way up in queens and was gonna take forever to drive them there. I think I started driving then we were back in the house. I remember the teammates were so darn frustrated about everything that they decided they would set fire to the house. I was running around hanging out with other people cuz there were a bunch there and I feel like there were some little kids I was playing with. I had a hunch about the fire but didn’t say anything and wanted to make sure the family was upstairs cuz it meant somehow they could escape. The fire was set and it started filling the bottom as they ran up so I went to alert everyone and I could see some of the flames and it was scary af and then I woke up.</span></div></body></html>
