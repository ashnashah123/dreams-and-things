It was close to the last rehearsal before the actual performance and so we got ready in position, started the intro video which lasted forever and half the team went in the room backstage to get ready in costume and get in position. The ppl w me on stage didn’t have costume on cuz we thought it was still rehearsal but soon realized after the lonnng intro video that we were doing the actual thing and so we scrambled to throw on our costumes. There was some issue w our lipstick and we had to keep reapplying for some reason but I remember that being a stress point. The show was already delayed for the audience and so we freaked out cuz this already makes us look bad. It was actually a show w other performers (dance 4 me I think) but no one else was in sight for the performances. I put on my costume and suddenly the skirt was above my knees and way too short. So I freaked out and ran backstage to see if I could trade w anyone and there was one girl and so we traded (for some reason our skirts were like large glittery fishnet which is not at all what they really look like) and unfortunately the one I switched w was even shorter so it looked like a mermaid and so we all freaked out cuz we had to perform and the place we could go to for alterations/maybe to buy a new costume was 30+ mins away driving so that wasn’t possible. We learned that the skirts shrunk cuz one of the team “dads” put them in the shitty wash/dryer on campus. All of a sudden I remembered that I actually am a guy in the dances so I didn’t even have to wear the skirt....so that time was all wasted lol and I rushed to find a guy costume and I think I did but it may have been a bit big so we had to safety pin everything quickly. We tried to find a hack for the other girl whose skirt was also a bit short. Next thing I know I’m back on stage finally ready to go and we get in position and someone covers us with the big dome type of thing you use to cover like a platter of food and lifted it up to reveal us as we started dancing.</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
