Willa was blonde and looked like 100% different and when she entered someone was pointing out the differences and I kinda forgot what the real Willa looked like until much later. We all ordered drinks and food and the waitress was annoyed cuz I didn’t know what I wanted even tho she never gave me a menu so I used the one she was holding just for show. After we ordered the other waitress came around with an assortment of branded goodies such as shot glasses, temp tattoos, straws etc. and I decided to take a pink and purple sparkly tattoo that I would put near my rib cage which literally said the name of the restaurant I think. No one else took stuff and then eventually somehow I remembered what Willa looked like and I think she might’ve transformed back to her normal looking self.</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
