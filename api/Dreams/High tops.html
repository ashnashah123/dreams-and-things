She was supposed to listen to what I wanted out of it and then help me pick (funny cuz you’d think that’s what my advisor would do) and I was supposed to report back to my advisor. I went to the office thing and it was a glass tower like 3 floors high that was inside another fully glass building where students were roaming around</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;">  </span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;">and she was just chilling inside. I was using google maps to find her and ran into Luke in the building and he was like what ru doing here and I responded with the same question. I think Luke was with his team and also Adam was there. I went in her office and she had me sit on a rolly chair and I started telling her bout what I wanted. Luke kept slipping in and out of the office to get like a stapler and then paper clips and then was straight up standing in the office with his team and I was so confused. I remember noticing Adam had converse on and Luke had these cool purple high tops with subtle magenta flowers on them. I noted that I had to compliment them but after the meeting obv. The lady and I decided I’d prob apply for a dialogue in Seattle and then I left and ran into Kristen who was searching for a water spill from the night before out in the grass lol.</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;"><br/></span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;"><br/></span></div></body></html>
