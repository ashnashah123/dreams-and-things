Then someone I was with just flipped the board upside down so we could work on the other side and I was pretty annoyed that happened. I think we cleaned it up and left the stuff in these big bins full of Christmas decorations and thought we left them inside the house (my old house) just behind the glass door since we were getting ready to put them up soon. A little bit later my mom and I noticed that the bin was empty and outside the glass door so we ran over and saw that the 3 bins full of our Christmas decorations and our tree were empty and there was a paper hanging on the tree saying “we will bring this back soon” I grabbed it and flipped it over and it had a bunch of addresses and peoples names from Delaware (it was a contact list sorta like the one you would get in elementary school with all the parents’ names) so we figured they stole everything and were also confused cuz we thought we locked the glass door but maybe it was unlocked and someone came and took it all.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
