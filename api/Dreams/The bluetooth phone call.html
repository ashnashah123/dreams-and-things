I did this camping sort of thing w a bunch of ppl and the last night I hadn’t charged my phone and it died overnight and so I couldn’t keep track of the time and when I had to leave for the flight. Someone gave me a Fitbit cuz she had 2 and so I was attempting to use that to check when I had to leave and I was late anyway but I called an Uber and made it. My grandma was also at the airport and had a flight in 40 mins from the current time. Meanwhile Shreya was also at the airport and it was her wedding but also her 21st bday party and her grandma also had a flight in 40 mins and our grandmas didn’t like each other so they were both coming from opposite directions and kinda were racing bc they found out that they were on the same flight. Shreya got some really bad news like someone was injured or something so she rushed home w me and eventually Andrea came by herself bc she was like I can’t let u go alone you’re my best friend. And somehow Shreya lived in Sacramento and everything felt vintage and it made me feel like that’s what Cali should be (except there were no beaches just a small river). Me Shreya and Julia (my bff from hs) (somehow she was there) were driving towards your house and there were gargoyles or something tryna jump off the bridge and get us. Somehow we also were really close to Belgium and there was a dude there who died and there was this big ceremony thing and I had to go attend it. We made it to shreyas house and everything was ok and so Shreya started checking her closet for clothes to wear for her 21st bday party (not sure what happened to her wedding which probs happened in Norway) and I was helping look thru. Shreya got word that Mimi (shreyas bff from hs), who had flown back from Norway and had to go back to GA tech was gonna “Bluetooth call” in for her bday party so she was really excited. It ended with me reading a stack of mail my dad sent and I was reading a poem someone wrote for the funeral in Belgium that I was to attend. The funeral was for these magical ppl who were doctors and it was gonna take place like on top of a bridge and was not a typical funeral at all.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-stretch: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal;"
