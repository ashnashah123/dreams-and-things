I had this crazy good dream but I can hardly remember it but all I do remember was that I had to do some coding or some sort of academic challenge and like eventually ciarra showed up late and had to do it quickly but she were also pretty high. And then at some point we left and went near where Carlo was (this straight up didn’t look like school or anything) and he had coffee that had weed in it and he offered to us and I was like nah and ciarra almost had some and I was like NO Ciarra and shes like okk. My mom made an appearance at some point but not when ciarra was high</span><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
