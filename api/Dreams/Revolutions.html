It was some big day occurring (I think having to do w the stock market so the plan - also all of a sudden we were in NYC - was to grab food then walk down Wall Street since that’s what everyone was doing. There was a sort of serious overtone to the day despite the day representing some sort of exciting thing. We had some friends on the corner of Wall Street selling like lemonade or something bright and colorful and wanted to meet up w them when we started. I also looked at the world from some sort of satellite view and Russia was red while the rest was green and that’s bc there were people all standing in protest but then there were army members littered all over the streets watching for any revolutions (it might’ve been called Revolution day) and ready to strike back. (Kinda like in the hunger games) Because there were so many ppl Russia appeared red from such a high up view. This revolution day was supposedly happening in other countries all around the world too so pretty big day. You came and were dressed in a white burka I think and had a really grown out your beard and saif was also dressed up I think as someone and we asked who you were and you were like I’m the....Muslim Man (everyone said the Muslim man part together except for me because everyone knew who that was except for me - apparently some important historical character.) We were all sitting in some stagecoach at the time and I don’t think we ever got out to go walk around cuz I woke up.</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
