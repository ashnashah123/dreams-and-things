Met with my friends and then we went inside for this meetup with people our age and we were all in a group for something. We had to one by one introduce ourselves by answering a few questions. When I went up I was answering the question “are you calm” and I said I was but I have a ton of energy, and then as I was elaborating there was a bunch of talking and laughing that started so I had to restart. All of a sudden there was one kid who was SO TALL (learned he was 7’8”) and he started chasing me through the hallway into another room idk why. I think he was mad or jealous or something. I managed to skrrt around and then make it back to the main room and so did he but then he was no longer mad. I finally got my chance to speak about myself and turns out I closed my eyes for much of it because everyone laughed for some reason and the tallness of some people intimidated me a bit so I forgot to finish the yummy food they provided (I had chickpeas Indian style and some tomato bisque which was green for some reason lol). I ate it after when I sat back down and my friend reminded me I hadn’t eaten. </div><div><br/></div><div>Somehow this changed a bunch. I was with my mom and we were going to my grandparents house for our summer holiday thing with my cousins. I had packed my bike in the car and brought it with us. Idk why. Once we got there turns out we were at a field hockey stadium and a very famous Indian actress (Deepika padukone) was on the Indian team and it was like some world cup game or something and she was feeling very sick and/or injured and so as everyone lined up and were ready for the play to start, she dropped down on her knees and threw her hands in the air (basically a sign she didn’t want to play and got her team out for the tournament bc she moved). Everyone was kinda freaking out and her husband (another famous actor) ran onto the field and was like whyyyy but he also understood that she really couldn’t play. So I left and went to walk around near the cars. It looked like a train station and all the cars were parked along the gap where the train would come, but instead the field hockey stadium was in the gap and I guess mini sized so I must’ve shrunk or something. I was with some person and telling him about the bike and he was like lol we’re in New Jersey it’s DEFINITELY stolen even tho u say it’s in the locked car. I was like psh nah it’s probably fine but we o obviously went to look for it. All we talked about was how it was probably stolen and I was like chill man. I think we eventually found the car parked somewhere other than where my mom parked it and long behold, the bike was there! </div><div><br/></div><div>I lowkey feel like there was something to do with Patagonia in the dream cuz I remember as soon as I woke up but was still too sleepy to type it out I was thinking I should name the dream Patagonia lol. </div></body></html>
