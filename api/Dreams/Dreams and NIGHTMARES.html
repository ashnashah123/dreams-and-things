Then randomly I decided to go to the craft store to get wrapping paper for your Christmas gift which was a book and then I was gonna come back. It was raining and dark outside and I ran into my mom at the store who reminded me not to come home too late (was roughly 6pm) and then the store experience was weird but all of a sudden Akash was walking back to the car w me. We got in and turns out I guess it wasn’t locked cuz we belted and then I saw some homeless man sitting in the trunk with his back to us and so we freaked but didn’t say anything til he turned around and then I started screaming at him to get out and he opened his mouth to talk but no sounds came out and he just creepily smiled but also didn’t know what was going on and then we started calling 911 and I even had opened the trunk w a button from the front of the car but this man would not leave</div></body></html>
