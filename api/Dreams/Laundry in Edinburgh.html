The restaurant had a nice wooden dock out front and ppl were hanging out everywhere. We were there for a while and then were still deciding if we wanted to go to the city or not and some of our friends Matt and AJ who had studied abroad here last semester had already made it. Across the lake was the royal mile which is just a touristy type of street where on one end is the Edinburgh castle and the other is the palace. It was such a nice day but then it started to get dark and Ciarra started having second thoughts for some reason (I think bc she needed to do her laundry) and just as I was about to say ya let’s go, a HUGE crack of thunder and lightning hit and I was like JK we’re going home turn around.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">  </span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">The castle and got set on fire and basically there was a huge fire that was like one giant blob that was moving around the city (and like circling around the lake slowly) so everything suddenly caught fire but only from the inside and you could just see the insides of buildings just had fire in them and then the restaurant started to catch fire too and somehow we made it back to our dorm which was apparently in some high tower and we could see the castle set on fire from there. It had also become light outside again just after the initial lightning strike. Ciarra was super concerned bc she had to do laundry and so was i but one of us was scared the lightning could strike the dryer and make all our clothes catch on fire. While we were deciding I was just looking outside at the burning castle and it looked like fire was spurting out of one of the side towers and the fire actually looked like an emoji (even more animated than the one on the keyboard) and like it was individual emojis spurting out in bursts and they made a funny noise as it happened. Some kid was takin pics from outside but I took them from my dorm and then Ciarra came in and was like I REALLY want to do my laundry and I was like alright ya let’s do it and then I woke up</span></div></body></html>
