I finally said no bc I was so tired and had stuff to do esp since I had just come home and so Aashka decided to take it and they went clubbing.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">Back at the apartment Luke was having a party w his running folk but it was like everyone was just sitting around and one person would go up and act something out so it was like charades basically and then I walked down the street which was somehow connected to the inside of the apartment and walked to some Indian place or something and I think my dance team ppl who I don’t even like were there. Then I came back and I think started watching the news or something and Luke and his girlfriend Sarah were on it!! Not really sure why or who Sarah was. And then I went to go see what Luke was up to and the party had ended and he was sittin on the couch and then went into his room so I followed him and he was packing his bag for some reason. So I asked where he was going and he was going to a friends house? And then idk I think I kept asking him questions for a while and then I went to bed or something</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
