My aunt who was in charge explained to us that there was a container w lentils and we had to fry them but once we were done we had to dispose of everything correctly and put the large spoon back in the lentils container which was next to impossible bc the spoon was basically a small pot. We also wondered how the spoon got in the container in the first place. We were kinda just walking around the main floor which was just a small circle and waited for them to cook and suddenly there was a problem w the lentils and we had to quickly put the spoon in and leave to dispose the oil. So we brought the spoon and container and oil and I think we were flying around on something idk what cuz it wasn’t broomsticks. Maybe just straight up flying.  We realized Hermione was missing and somehow figured out she was stuck in the Weasley’s flying car and we needed to get her back. We wished we were on broomsticks so she could jump out of the car and we could catch her. As she was approaching us in this super fast and uncontrolled flying car we somehow all of a sudden were in a controlled flying car and we basically had her drive in thru where the door closes (the door was shut so she had to squeeze in thru the crack) and it was all very intense cuz we had to time it quickly and we were all moving fast and shouting ahhhh and then she and the car she was in (which had somehow shrunk) nailed the timing and made it in the car and she just expanded instantly back to normal size and the car kinda just chilled and only expanded a little and then the alarm went off and I jumped awake.</span></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
