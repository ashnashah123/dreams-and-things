Manas was in SD and we were trying to hit the bike shop to get new bikes I think. However, we were trying to go against the car culture and just skateboard over. Somehow there was a delivery from my mom that was my “skateboard” but that actually looked like the pink round mushroom chair I have and I was somehow supposed to ride down the hills and maneuver that thing but it also had wheels and was sorta a skateboard? It was pretty difficult to do but I was figuring it out. I left like an hour before manas and then as I was going down some lady stepped outside her house and was asking what I was doing so I started explaining how I didn’t want to drive and this was a new and better method of transportation. Manas eventually caught up to me since he had a normal board which he actually could ride and then we entered the bike shop together. We were talking I think and then eventually were walking along the grassy part at the top of the beach and I met up with my fam friends from San Jose and then it was getting late and a bunch of young kids came to the class manas and I were teaching on the grass. I really can’t remember what it was..maybe like how to build a bike or something about bikes? Although we didn’t have any bikes on us? And I think we all set up a bunch of tents and then the stars started coming out but something sorta mysterious was happening to my friend?? I feel like I remember us leaving and going back up the road but it’s very hazy…</font></span></div></body></html>
