Idk why it was at my grandparents’ house cuz they had nothing to do with this dream but I got there and i found out it was dog free and then it immediately flashed to me somewhere else in San Jose or something visiting fam friends there and my really good friend from growing up called me out and said I was a horrible friend now. It flashed again to me driving to the sleepover at my grandparents house but this time we allowed dogs to come. I got there and had brought my two puppers. One was tiny like a large webkinz and gray and had all curly hair maybe like a golden doodle but gray. I was holding him trying to bring him inside and accidentally let go and he ran around outside which wasn’t safe so I had to scramble and get him back and bring him in quickly along w some bags I had. I care back out to get my second dog which looked like Becca’s dog and I just couldn’t find him in the car since there was so much stuff and was getting concerned. Somehow my grandma and mom were in the car inspecting things in the driver/passenger seat and I walked around and found that the dog was under the passenger seat. Manas showed up and was helping me look/helping with my stuff. My mom and grandma were no longer there and I got the dog and held it so tight but felt bad and just tried as fast as possible to bring it in and not let go.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">I brought it in and had some backpacks and duffel with me and as soon as I put it down, I somehow was snap chatting something to the friend from earlier. There was a famous actress whose name I could not remember and I was just zooming in on her face and pretty dress and sending snaps to the friend. Apparently my friend had somehow gotten her to come so I was in awe. I noticed the actress was walking on a red carpet and realized the oscars were going on in this house and there were at least 200 more people than expected and everyone was sitting in bleachers watching live. I saw my friend sitting a few rows back and she clearly didn’t want to save me a seat bc I was a bad friend so I sat elsewhere near Kenneth who was apparently there, and I also noticed everyone was writing something down every time a name got called. I personally just started taking notes and wanted to see if I could figure out that actresses name bc I wanted to try to mend that friendship and thought at least knowing what she was up to would be a good start. I then looked over at Kenneth’s paper and saw that everyone was doing squares like you do during the super bowl mixed with bingo and Kenneth was like it’s oscar squares! So they ticked off a name every time the awards were presented. I felt very confused cuz I had never heard of this but literally everyone knew what was going on and then the dream phased out.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
