We had to pick up two of our friends who live in the complex next door and meet at Intuit at 8:45. However, we decided to pick up food before we went and drove down to Miramar to explore for some food. The area was kinda run down and lots of people were everywhere and some taking pics. We got stuck finding and getting food and I looked at my watch and it said it was 11:00am and I was like oh it’s fine that’s in EST so we still have 30-45 mins. But I also thought to myself that how could I be in EST still..suddenly our friends were with us and we still had to get food for them too so we roamed around. I had some Pakistani food in a bag and was walking back to the car and a black and white pigeon came towards me and I was tryna kick it away. Got in the car and it was now 11:30 and I kept saying we had to meet at “school” but we started heading to the airport and then I realized that I wasn’t processing we were late bc I kept saying school and not work so I had no point of reference. So we turned around and went towards work only to remember that our flight was prob gonna take off soon so we might as well go to airport. </div><div><br/></div><div>I woke up in a daze and then half fell asleep and dreamt I was typing out this dream and it was very detailed (so when I woke up for real I figured I had no choice but to remember and type it out) and then I went to my aunts big new house (who doesn’t have kids) for Xmas and there were new pics of all the cousins on the wall blown up. We had all arrived with tons of stuff as if we were all moving there and then there were 4 pics of each cousin on the walls and mine were all of me dancing when I was younger and if you stared at them long enough they’d give a little preview and move around sorta like Harry Potter pics, so mine showed me dancing. Somehow my coworkers was on that and he was supposedly on a Bhangra team at BU (which is just false) so I was in awe watching the preview. My mom was standing up on the second floor and was readjusting a decoration and it must’ve hit a small green glass circle that lined the staircase and the circle fell and took down a flower and shattered on the table below. She was like I’m sorry I really didn’t know that the stuff was there and all the adults were so mad that happened and there was just an angry vibe among everyone all of a sudden. </div></body></html>
