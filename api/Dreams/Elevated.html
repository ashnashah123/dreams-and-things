Apparently the strength was the lowest (and the lowest started at 10g and went up to like 40 which is obv ridic in real life but like it was very mild in the dream) and so I took it and it wasn’t too bad. Think I started feeling like buzzed or something when I went to this class outside and these two ppl from my high school started singing a song and awkwardly dancing and shaking their shoulders about Jon bellion from like the early 1900s which makes no sense cuz he obv wasn’t alive and so I gave my friend sitting next to me a weird look bc we were both confused(might have been Luke but Idk) and wrote that song down in my notebook to check out.</span><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
