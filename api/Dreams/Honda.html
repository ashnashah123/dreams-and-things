That evening however, somehow my coworker ameya needed to be dropped off at the airport so you told me this: “can you drop ameya at the airport please. I’m throwing a party tonight and my friends are gonna show up pretty hammered and also are bringing a bunch of food.” I was like wtf and said it would be nice if you could save some food to which you responded that there prob wouldn’t be any so I was like um ok can you please lmk when I’m gone so that I can know if I should stop somewhere else and get my own food. And you were like uhh pretty much assumed you were gonna get your own stuff...and then it got real tense and we just stared at each other and I was pissed. </div><div><br/></div><div>Then it was the convention. I realized I didn’t technically sign up for it and it was a 3 day thing. First day was called rolling talks, second day was the longer stuff I think (maybe called “lambdas”?¿) and third was solely security based or something. Since it was a workday I still went in, and I think it was sorta taking place in Vegas idk. I sat down away from you at a diff table and we all received backpacks. I got the my normal blue one back cuz I guess it was missing. When I opened it there was a postcard in there from Honda saying “yes we accept!!” And then I learned quickly from my team director who showed up that it meant that Honda was gonna be the official driver of HackBeanpot!! We apparently had reached out to other car companies but they weren’t crazy about it and Honda was hype lol esp bc the minivan would fit lots of people. I started imagining minivans covered in hbp stickers (like your cooler lol) rolling up to the event. Pretty exciting stuff. I then stayed for the talks that day and basically was debating if I should come back the other days cuz it seemed pretty interesting. I was keeping track of what table you were at and just avoiding it lmao </div></body></html>
