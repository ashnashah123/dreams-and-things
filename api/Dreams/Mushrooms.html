I did that and then the next day when a bunch of us (like Will, Jesse, and other volleyball peeps) were at the beach and Will was like hey nice job complimenting a fellow “boarder" (Mary!) that takes guts to do, and I was like lol thanks. A bunch of us were walking down the beach and noticed these small dark red hard circular stones in the sand that had some sort of super small spikes on them and they started around this one area and were kind of in a zig zag pattern/line down a section of the beach for a little bit and we were pretty confused and they looked a little suspicious so we kind of hung around them for a bit. Pretty soon someone noticed I think that they had grown into something a bit bigger that looked like a very small mushroom that was bright red and had red spots (like the mario kart ones) and were a little spiky. We were quite confused and then noticed more and more growing. I think more people came to join at the beach and we started discussing this weird thing happening and all were trying to avoid touching the mushrooms. </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.38; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal;-en-paragraph:true;">Next thing we knew was that somehow there was part of the ocean that ran thru the beach, parallel to the coast but further up on the beach so it looked like a river flowing through the sand and somehow all the sand had just stopped right at the “river” and we didn’t even have to do anything to avoid falling in. We saw this lady who was really fit swimming down the river and then realized she was swimming toward the suspicious mushroom patch and all of a sudden she started spinning around in the water to try to get herself out of this yellow liquid that was clearly from the mushrooms and had started swirling around her because she realized what was happening and was attempting to get it out. We weren’t sure how much she got out of her system but she seemed more fine in the water. Some other lady had the same thing happen to her when she was with the other lady and i think she shouted to us that all the water was infected and everything was yellow (which was false because she actually was encased in a bubble with the yellow liquid so all she could see was everything tinted yellow) but the bubble was too strong for her that she wasn’t spinning at all and we don’t know the final outcome but some ambulances came and the ladies were hospitalized. I remember we discussed that the best way to get this stuff out would be to use a centrifuge of sorts so that everything can be removed but obviously that was not available for the ladies in the water. </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.38; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal;-en-paragraph:true;">Next thing I know, Sam and 2 other girls I knew (maybe the ladies or maybe 2 other ppl) were also hospitalized due to this mushroom fluid. I then went to the hospital cuz I also wanted to investigate what was going on. I was trying to get one of the three people I knew there to realize that I was there and call me back to their room so I could start the investigation (and obviously check in on them). Sam called me back, and she was all woozy and bloody and infected and her family was also there and kinda part of it also needing treatment. We knew the mushrooms had something to do with it and the doctors were not very helpful at all, in fact they seemed incredibly suspicious (seemed something like they had to do with the mushrooms and reminded me a little of stranger things with the lab doing experiments and infecting people). Sam left the hospital (it was the UPenn hospital in Philly) because I think she kinda knew something was up and she really was not in the state to do so since she was still incredibly fragile and woozy but she left and called me from right outside and was saying something about how an ambulance was coming and then I heard the siren on the phone and then I heard a big crash and was like oh SHIT she just got run over. I knew it was premeditated and was getting more and more suspicious of this hospital and the doctors there. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap; --inversion-type-color:  simple; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;">All of a sudden it flashed away from San Diego and Philly and the whole conspiracy. I was with my cousins on our big family trip and we and my aunts and uncles were all in this BIG pool that and there were waves here and there. I remember I was about to text Luke that he would not appreciate my living habits if I were with my cousins everyday since we stay up super late all the time and it would be insanely bad for me. We were waiting for everyone to arrive and the pool somehow had all these waves and so we were just kind of avoiding them.  Then there was this BIG wave, just like the one Sandro painted at the paint night, and he was there swimming around with us too for some reason. We didn’t surf, just watched the waves and I think some random people were there surfing too. I started thinking about the mushrooms and was concerned about the happenings. I think some people from my team at work were at this pool and were quietly discussing the mushrooms as well. </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.38; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal;-en-paragraph:true;">I then went back to the beach in SD cuz I realized that I needed to figure out what the heck was going on with these doctors and mushrooms and everything was getting bigger. There were big black spires with red balls on them and spikes everywhere along with the big patch of mushrooms that looked like the mario kart ones but really spiky. I think some of the things were part of a platform that were blown up and I noticed it so I realized it was fake (but I think in the dream I thought they were real and in real life I realized they were just blown up cuz it was a dream..is that lucid dreaming?!?!?) but we tossed away the blown up thing and were investigating the massive mushroom patch that had now grown (to the size of probably half a volleyball court) </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.38; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal;-en-paragraph:true;">All of us volleyball people then decided to disband since we did have to go back to work at some point and I knew that I had to go back to the hospital to keep investigating this thing and I was hoping others would too, and I’m pretty sure they did. I was trying to resync with a lot of them but I did know that some were pretty invested in figuring this out so I was relieved. I kept trying to get into the hospital and “visit” patients and talk to the doctors but they would not let me in since I think they had a feeling I was onto them. I was just waiting in the waiting room and kept trying to talk to as many people as I could and then…as it was getting pretty close to me figuring more and more out…I. WOKE. UP.  </span></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
