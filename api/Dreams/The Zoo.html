Then we had gotten to this “zoo” sort of thing that was opened up by someone my kaka knew I think and were supposed to go see it before we headed to another grad party. We apparently had to go to the other grad party bc the parents or grandparents of the kid were really old and we wanted to see them before it was too late (this is people we know which also makes this so weird). Then we get into the zoo but it was all indoors kind of like a small museum and as we walk in the lady gives everyone an animal to hold and mine was so weird like it looked like a mix of so many animals but it was soft and fluffy, but also kinda hard (you’ll see why) so i had to hold it the whole time and apparently the animals everyone got were considered lucky. BUT plot twist, this zoo is actually like a research place and all the animals are robotic and not real but the idea is to simulate real animals which the lady did a pretty good job of. So when she told us that I felt a lot less scared of the zebras and lions we were near lol. I had also come to love the little pet that I had to hold which apparently was derived from a camel. Then we were getting ready to leave and I can’t remember any more than that.</span></div></body></html>
