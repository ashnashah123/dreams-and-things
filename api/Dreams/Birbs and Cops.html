The pigeons all flew into the corner of the room. Meanwhile in the backyard there was a cop present on the lawn and was talking to the neighbors and they had something set up in the field. A bit later the pigeons were gone from the upstairs and I needed to go down and find some shoes of mine. There was a giant Tupperware box that I wanted to check but I knew all 100 pigeons were stuck in there. So I carefully tipped over the box with my foot and they went FLYING out and went to the corner of that room in an opposite direction from me and it was still so freaky cuz I had to walk by them and I didn’t even end up finding my shoes so I came upstairs really upset to my mom that I had to go do that. Meanwhile I looked in the backyard and it looked like there were tiny sparks and fire everywhere because the cop was backing up into other yards and then coming forward with full speed and generating sparks as he went and then he half went off a ramp and was trying to crash into a test car that was somehow suspended in the air and then would go back and do it again. And so I figured they were doing a science fair experiment and obv had to use the cop bc they’d need permission to do this so might as well just use him. I watched all this as I was thinking about how I needed to open the basement door that led to the outside so I could get the pigeons out but the problem was that the door was right in the corner and so I’d have to walk thru them or be on the other side of the door and have them all fly at me. I shuddered at the thought and woke up.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
