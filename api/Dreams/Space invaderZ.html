I was with my dad and Akash and we had the elite video game guns which I think were called light sabers except they didn’t look like traditional ones. Most people who attend this don’t Have the fancy ones so that means they typically stay on the ground floor until they feel comfortable enough to move up. They can still shoot at the people on the top because it’s just a big balcony but the people with light sabers get preference and can shoot downwards which is why they are at the top. In the dream, we arrived in the middle of the conference so all the running around started so we just had to sprint up, grab some equipment from the rooms that were all next to the indoor balcony (which wasn’t even actually ours but somehow we had the status to be upstairs) and we got to fight. We talked to people and they were talking about how intense this can get and how even though nothing is actually being shot (it’s like lasers) people have died. Also many girls typically don’t show up to this. </span></div><div><br/></div><div>We grabbed stuff but it was like shields not even guns and were trying to run back down to get people and somehow we were just avoiding everything and doing decently. We ran into Akash’s friend Justin from high school who told us some story about how he and Akash were driving somewhere and they were watching Netflix “safely” which I obviously did not believe. I remember talking to someone and commenting how the grace hopper convention center was wayyyy bigger than this but we also were at one of the Grace hopper convention centers? </div><div><br/></div><div>We kept playing and there were targets that looked like the alien things in space invaders that we had to hit also and basically it was swarms of people moving in lines up and down playing this game. It seemed sorta mechanical. Eventually the dream like restarted and we reentered the building and this time I think we had more equipment but kind of repeated the heading upstairs and getting ready to play again and not sure what happened from there. </div></body></html>
