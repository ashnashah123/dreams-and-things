I went home and we had just moved recently so like all my stuff was out of place and i was annoyed cuz i like my organized chaos and i was in a rush so i had to find something. You were stiting on your bed and were extremely salty that i was going out lol. I was rifiling thru a fuck ton of clothes and grabbed a massive pile and brought it into the bathroom to pick out something. your face was getting uglier by the minute cuz u were so salty and then a while later i threw something together and had a massive pile of clothes that i brought out of the bathroom and just dumped on the floor. got nervous cuz i knew someone would yell at me for leaving a mess but i just ran out</span></div></body></html>
