They specifically needed someone “small and cute, just a generally small person” and this one kid who’s p tall and plays volleyball suggested me and I was like yeah suppose I could but also I feel like I should be at the office cuz I’m still relatively new and it’s kinda weird if I’m wfh</div></body></html>
