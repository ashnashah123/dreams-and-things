One was about me coming home to Parker hill but it didn’t really look like it and like my 4th floor friends were there watching football season prep leading up to the kickoff of the first game (but it was California time technically so it felt weird watching what was supposed to be a night game). Then also I was trying to find the sublet who took your room but he was cooking and apparently my mom said he just burned everything that he cooked lol. And finally, there was an event for club running going on in the backyard and it was sorta like a field day so everyone was competing in physical activities and one of which included bananagrams tiles flying all over the place and I was trying to find you but then remembered you were on the road trip but the NUCR activities were still being hosted at the house and everyone kept staring at me or trying to interrogate me lol. I was extremely confused when I woke up cuz I thought it was like 8pm but it was only like 8:30am and had been 30 mins since I checked the time and was in a total daze</span><br/></div></body></html>
