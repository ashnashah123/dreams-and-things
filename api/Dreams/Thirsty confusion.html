Turns out I had only slept for 9 min but it felt like a lifetime. Then I passed out real hard again and when I woke up to my alarm I was caught so off guard that it had been another 30 mins cuz I felt like I barely slept and so I kept dozing in and outta sleep and now it’s 34 mins past my alarm and I NEED to get up but I’m in that weird dazed state and could definitely sleep more. I also coulda sworn I  saw some texts from my mom the first time I woke up but then I checked my phone again and that was just a myth and I was just seeing things</div><div>This literally sounds like a dream</div><div>I also coulda sworn Noah popped his head into the room and said something but again, I was confused bc the door was shut and idk how it would’ve been open. So that was a figment of my imagination too lol</div><div><br/></div></body></html>
