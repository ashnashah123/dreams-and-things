They like Lowkey had a thing going on so when they saw each other they like ran and hugged so hard and I was like k. And then I think we were like wandering to that bright house and like goofing off. I feel like there was some crazy thing that happened in a hotel and we were involved but I cannot remember for the life of me atm. Will update if I remember more but sadly itâ€™s kinda hazy</span></div></body></html>
