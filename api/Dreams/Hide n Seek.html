In the morning we were hanging out and I was playing some jank monopoly that Luke brought with Shreya and Aalisha but I was half sleeping but also sorta hiding. We were on a makeshift roof inside a room and I was also somehow hiding behind a bunch of bottles like the piece in the MFA. Eventually I slept a little and then woke up a little more to play monopoly. We didn’t have all the cards we needed so we kept getting up to grab the rest from under the Xmas tree. Then I think I was staring thru the bottles and my friends were all trying to find each other and I saw mike thru them and we made eye contact and just smiled cuz then I kinda knew where he was so we all tried to find each other and just couldn’t find him (even tho he’d be somewhere where he could reflect off the bottles. We all left and went to another room to get food and mingle I think. My grandparents and bunch of older relatives were also there (it was like thanksgiving reunion) eating Indian snacks and talking. I saw some ppl from high school who told me my friend may have been in the room still (we were still wondering where mike was but only half searching). We went back thru the hallway and into the room (I passed by dadi who said something about board games but she was on her way upstairs for another activity) and in the room I started searching and the room had little sub rooms with bottles in them. Eventually I found mike and he apparnelty had just been sitting there for like 5 hours cuz he was pretty tired and didn’t feel like getting up (it was 1pm by now) and a min later my 4th floor peeps rushed back in and we all got hype to see him and then I took a snap of the CAR and before I could send it I started talking to daddy and some friend of his and he was telling me that during pres day (which actually was supposed to mean the end of winter break) I was gonna hitch a ride from his friend who was gonna go drive west to go skiing in Western Canada</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;">  </span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;">(at McGill??) and we would pass thru Colorado also. I’d bring my skis but then I was like how am I supposed to get to Boston and luckily the friend was like oh I also love going to Boston so I’m gonna drive you there after we ski for two days. I got super excited and thought about how I’d be able to bring my skis but also wondered how I’d get the car back up to Boston after break. Then I opened my phone and tried to create a snap group for just the CAR and it took forever but I made it, sent the snap and woke up.</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
