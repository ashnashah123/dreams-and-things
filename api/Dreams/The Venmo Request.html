So we drove up and I was hosting a party in my own apartment for some reason and got it all set up. All my chairs had done writing on them and one room was the “party room” and the other her s small bed/couch thing and a table where the drinks were. The cups were in cool random pyramid formations and such. Once people started arriving they obv were drinking more then I do so I stayed in the couch bed and just chilled waiting for you to come and some other ppl. Eventually you showed up at the same time as a group of people I didn’t really know (some friend of friends at party). When you guys came I was confused bc I don’t remember you climbing stairs but somehow I was on the 2nd floor. You knew someone waiting outside and gave him a.big hug cuz it had been white a while and then when you came we went to the couch cuz it was 1am (you had stuff before) and so I told you ppl were getting hammered so if you wanted to you’d have to just pound shots or something but you decided not to. You literally just ran also so you were very sweaty but we made out for a while then I went to the other room to mingle and drank a little then went to a room with a bathroom and some ppl who were my friends who I also owed money to. They said if I had to puke I could and so I randomly just did and in their sink not the toilet and they were like uh.. then I had to leave and I wanted to Venmo the caterer $300 bit I did a “physical Venmo” where you arrive the amount on something so I gave him a Christmas ornament but it didn’t have his username so I was like oh I’ll just do it electronically then and he got butthurt cuz he had never left a Venmo request unfulfilled (the physical one was technically gonna be unfulfilled) and I was like k. I walked home and my family had been throwing a party also and it was technically the leftover people from my party too and my dad introduced me to someone that I should talk to cuz this person was very motivational and stuff and So I chatted a him a bit and then I was just wanting food cuz it was 2am and I only had lunch. It kinda felt recursive because after I talked to the person I feel like the dream started over and repeated itself but then it ended when I wanted food.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
