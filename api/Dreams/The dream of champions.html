I ran back and realized I didn’t have my key so I knocked on neighbors door. We lived in more of an apartment thing so it was one floor and everything was connected. there was like a common room where people were hanging out and they stared at me as i knocked on the door bc the neighbors were stoners and if their door opened the common room would be flooded w the smell of ganga. But i knocked anyway. The room also had a blue light emanating from the crack through the door and the girl opened. Told her I needed help getting into my room and she assisted. I was hoping I’d be alone so i could grab the gloves and leave but that was not the case. I think Raquel and my mom were there and ofc they started talking to me about something I had to do and I was just anxious to leave since you were waiting and not running. I noticed my sneakers and thought possibly I should wear them (I was wearing my thicc flip flops) and i also was only wearing underwear on the bottom and my normal shirt lol so i also contemplated putting on pants before leaving. I didnt do either those and then ran back outside. So we ran to what was called a wildlife sanctuary but it was more of like the botanical garden museum but with rainforest animals so people are supposed to walk through and there are animals around that you look at. Somehow all of a sudden we were in a car as we arrived and were pulling in and these 3 guys (one of whom is alex lim, my friend noah’s friend and I think we recognized the others) and they were kinda drunk and one was sober and they were like omg we need help alex is too drunk we wanna take him home so I was like yeah ofc take the car we’re about to park it and go run inside the wildlife place anyway (without thinking how we would get back if they took the car) but then you were</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;">  </span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;">like how bout you guys just chill here in the parking garage and we will drive back w you when we are done in a half hour-hour. So they waited.</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">Inside the wildlife sanctuary I started regretting not wearing sneakers or pants more and more lol and somehow my flip flops were also gone and I just was barefoot. The path that the people had to walk was a tiny bit gravel-y and so i had to make sure to be careful how I walked. I somehow went ahead with some girls and we were looking around and there were scorpions nearby and something else called a “scorpia” which was a really large thing and its exhibit was very close to us. there was water dripping from the trees too every so often so we freaked out when the water would hit us and we could sense the scorpia was coming so we were a bit scared. There was also a river rushing under that simulated more of the rainforest feel and all of a sudden as we were about to start running (idk why we were running here cuz this was not very conducive to people running as there are other tourists there so I did feel kinda bad when we were about to start) there were some calls from the guys waiting in the car. They said that alex escaped and ran back inside and was missing his husky id and we kinda speculated he was floating thru the river. You decided to jump in and go check and I felt bad since you still had barely gotten to run but the river was rushing around and not sure if Alex got found (he probably did). But we did end up running more and they went back to the car and waited and you were like oh imma needa go faster so you prob sped up for a while and then we reconvened at the end.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">All of a sudden we were back from the wildlife sanctuary and were w my family at our annual gathering for a holiday celebrating brothers and sisters. However, there were like 4 other random guys there who I think were related to one of my relatives on the other side of fam so they were chilling w us and you were sitting there and maybe a few other random people (or at least they were supposed to be my relatives that I know well but I didnt really recognize them) and we were sitting in</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">  </span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">a big circle and people were chatting amongst themselves. I noticed some guy who was sticking a thick mechanical pencil up his nose and was staring at him as he did that and was like wut the hell and looked around to see if others also noticed (which I think some may have) and then i kept lookin around and chatting a bit, saw you and was tryna see your reaction to some people cuz this was all a bit strange but we just smiled at each other. Eventually we went for a walk and we were just catching up and I think and I was talking about how that day I had a bunch of problems (i.e. no proper shoes, no pants, locked outta the house, etc. and it was def the same day but i was talking about it as if it weren’t) You sneakily gave me a hug from behind which was nice and then there were other people around too and they just seemed to not notice anything and I couldn’t really hear them mumbling. I think everyone was getting ready for the sunset or something.</span></div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">Somehow in the backyard all of a sudden there looked like a tent set up and all of a sudden lots of people were there and it felt like one of the jain community picnics we would go to in the summer since that was the people there and also the teen murti were in the background (pronounced “theen murthi”, means 3 god statues, and they are these 3 huge statues of gods located kind of near the slums in gujarat (idk why i cant find on google images)). People were amazed that they were in the backyard and people were trying to climb up them. There were signs at the top saying “America” and maybe like Canada and then America again, don’t remember. So I thought it would be cool to try to climb and touch the signs and so I went and tried and it was pretty difficult just scaling the rock they were built into + the statues and so I stopped halfway. Went back and mingled with people and met up with my family and we tried to go as the sun was starting to set and everything looked really pretty. We also went maybe just to the base or something. I was so determined to make it up (other people were trying and a few succeeded) and as I was climbing suddenly they seemed way smaller than before and I just like latched my foot onto some footholds in the middle and was able to just move around and get my arms to reach the signs and I was just a huge person maybe half the size of the statues or so. So i touched the signs a few times for respect and then came down very satisfied. Some people may have seen me but not really sure and then I think i slowly woke up.</span></div></body></html>
