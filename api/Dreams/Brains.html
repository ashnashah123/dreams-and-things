I could see the lines where Akashs head was cut when the pieces were put back and so I said I’d try. Then I could feel light cutting and it was all fine even tho I “basically died” and was put back together. I wanted someone to take pictures so I could see my brain but no one did. The whole point of it was that it’s just your skull so it can just be put back together since it’s different pieces and isn’t actually touching or affecting your brain. Then I was riding on some train or something w coops and we ended up sitting on some steps outside a nice building that kinda looked like the Harvard library but buried under plants and a garden looking thing. Was talking about the head stuff to Eylam on the train and on the steps and all of a sudden I jumped up bc somehow I sat on a dead bird that he might’ve stepped on and killed???</span></div></body></html>
