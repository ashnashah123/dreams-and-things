The new one was so big I had to use two hands and it was basically an iPad and it came with a thick case around it and all. It was quite annoying to have but eventually I guess I got used to it. I was in a car and aparna didi I think and her daughter were there and kruti mami and her sister and ketaki aunty. I went into a room and Sanjana was there and I was explaining to her how to eat something that was in the freezer so I had to keep opening it and hoping stuff wouldn’t drop out of it.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">  </span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">Then I think I was back on the car and we had to play a game sort of like slide in order to do something and we put one little kid in a different car and locked the car since the area was a tiny bit sketch and it was day time. The rest of us went to the other car and the other little girl and rest of us played this game and then realized we should get her out of the other car. Instead we just put the other girl in and I had to leave to go back to the original room. There were a bunch of teenage aged girls who I had to call back one by one for this game where certain cards had to be flipped over and they were all so fascinated. I think I went back to the car and squished in the back w the little girls and then we started driving away and I was told my grandparents were gonna move to Minneapolis. I woke up wondering why they would move there and what Minneapolis would have for them besides cold weather.</span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"> </span></div></body></html>
